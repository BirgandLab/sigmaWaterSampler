sigmaWaterSampler
=================

This arduino program hijacks a sigma water sampler, manipulating the control arm. In this initial commit, it uses several external switches to control the arm, and pump water, however, it will be modified in short order to use an internal RTC and SDcard to take either timed discrete samples, or respond to external signals to take ad hoc samples.
